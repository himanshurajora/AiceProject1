        <h3>Welcome!!!!</h3>
this is the readme.txt file;
it gives you the basic idea about this project and licence policies

<b>About this project (Short Description):</b>
    1. This is an open source web project that is made with the idea graphical knowledge presentation.
    2. Used technologies, services, sources and tools: 
        HTML5, CSS, JQuery, BootStrap, Visual Studio Code (Text editor), icons8.com 
        (icons and imgs), google images, google answers and wikipedia. 
    
<b>Features: </b>
    1. This project is made to present the information in a super graphical way,
        We tried to make as simple as we could to use it.
    2. Its repository is available on github so that anyone can use its framework
       to create more website like this.
    3. It has its own search engine and also it provides some free and open source games to play
       on the same website.

<b>licence:</b> 
    It gives MIT licence that's why it's source code it open to everyone to be edited or modified

<b>Limitations:</b>
    1. It is a small project that's why its search engine has some limitations,
       You can only search the things that the website allow you to do.
    2. The biggest problem about this web project right now is that it doesn't work 
       on any kind of database system and server technology and it works only on css, js and
       html that's it is failed at containing large amount of data.
<b>Progress:</b>
    We are currently thinking about to upgrate it and make it a server depandent website
    that uses Database systems to load data directly from server and load diffrent data
    in the same framework as needed.

Ok this is all the basic information about the project.
We wish you a happy life! ENJOY!!
